   - cross-referencing locations
   - leverage other channels? SO?

 - Feedback
   - Feature Requests
   - Additional Platforms

 - Roadmap
   - how often do we release?
   - how far do we plan ahead?
   - how do we prioritize work?

 - Contributions
  - fixes
  - features

### Versioning

 - Year.Month.Build
 - Stable and Beta Channel (Insiders?)

### Issue Triage

Incoming issues should be grouped into one of these buckets:

#### Bugs and Defects

These are problems with the current app that are identified by users. These
should be reviewed to ensure they:

 - indicate the specific build associated with the issue
 - have instructions for reproducing the issue
 - have details about the impact and severity of the issue

Once enough detail has been captured, these should be prioritized by the team.
Severe bugs or bugs affecting many users would be prioritized above minor or low
impact bugs. Depending on the estimate for the work required, some bugs may not
necessarily need to be done by the core team. These could be marked as
"up-for-grabs" so that external contributors could get involved.

#### Enhancements

Changes or improvements to existing features of the application are generally
fine, but should have some review process before they are implemented.
Contributors are encouraged to open issues to discuss enhancements so that
other contributors can see and participate in the discussion, and the core team
can remain transparent about the interactions.

To ensure the quality of the application remains high over time, the core team
may need to work with the user proposing the change to clarify questions around:

 - user interface - appropriate use of styles, layout
 - user experience - ensure things are consistent, discoverable
 - quality - ensure the change does not adversely affect other features

#### Proposals

suggestions for new features or significant changes to the app

#### Out-of-scope

things we aren't going to address for the project, e.g. support Mercurial repositories
