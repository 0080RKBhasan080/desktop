See [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com) for more product-oriented
information about GitHub Desktop.

GitHub Desktop is an [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)-based GitHub app. It
is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and uses
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

## I want to use it!

Download it [for
macOS](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin) or
[for
Windows](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32).
You can install this alongside your existing GitHub Desktop for Mac or GitHub
Desktop for Windows application, however there is no current migration path to
import your existing repositories into the new application - but you can
drag-and-drop them onto the application to quickly move things across.

## I want to contribute!

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) document as this covers the
basics. The [docs](./docs) folder also contains more detailed documentation.
