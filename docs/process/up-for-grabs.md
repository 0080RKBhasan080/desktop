# Up for Grabs Issues

As the team is working furiously towards the 1.0 release, we'll identify issues
or bugs that can be categorised as something that:

 - has low impact, or has a known workaround
 - should be fixed
 - has a well-defined scope and/or reproduction
 - can be worked on independently of other tasks

These tasks will be labelled as `up-for-grabs` in the repository, and people
who want to contribute to the project should comment on the thread to let
the team know they're interested in picking this up.

Issues might also be marked as `first-contribution` to indicate they are small
tasks, and should take an hour or two once you've familiarized yourself with
the codebase.
