# Releases

## Iterations

To keep things simple, we should be releasing stable updates every four weeks.
This channel would be considered evergreen, like modern browsers, to keep
maintenance simple.

A preview channel would be available, for users who want to help test upcoming
features and get fixes sooner. This would be updated more frequently - somewhere
between daily and weekly - based on demand and churn.
