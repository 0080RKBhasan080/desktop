# How We Work

All changes are reviewed and the entire team is responsible for doing review.

The usual flow:

1. A contributor opens pull request.
2. If they're still working on it, they preface the title with `[WIP]`.
3. When it's ready for review, they comment on it saying so.
4. Suddenly a wild reviewer appears!
5. The reviewer assigns the PR to themselves.
6. The reviewer leaves line comments with suggestions or questions.
7. When the reviewer is done they comment on the PR with an emoji, meme, pokémon, or words.
8. The author responds to feedback, makes changes, etc.
9. When the author is ready for the reviewer to re-review, they comment on the PR with an emoji, meme, pokémon, or words.
10. Goto 6 until both parties are happy with the PR.
11. The reviewer merges the PR and deletes the branch.
