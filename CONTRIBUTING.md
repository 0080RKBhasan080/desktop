# How We Work

All changes are reviewed and the entire team is responsible for doing review.

The usual flow:

1. **Contributor** a opens pull request.
2. If they're still working on it, they preface the title with `[WIP]` (**W**ork **I**n **P**rogress).
3. When it's ready for review, they comment on it saying so.
4. Suddenly a wild **reviewer** appears!
5. **Reviewer** assigns the PR to themselves.
6. **Reviewer** leaves line comments with suggestions or questions.
7. When the **reviewer** is done they comment on the PR with an emoji, meme, pokémon, or words.
8. The **contributor** responds to feedback, makes changes, etc.
9. When the **contributor** is ready for the **reviewer** to re-review, they comment on the PR with an emoji, meme, pokémon, or words.
10. Goto 6 until both parties are happy with the PR.
11. The **reviewer** merges the PR and deletes the branch.
