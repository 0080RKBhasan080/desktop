# How We Work

All changes are reviewed and the entire team is responsible for doing review.

The usual flow:

1. **Contributor** opens pull request.
1. When it's ready for review, they comment on it saying so and add the `ready-for-review` label.
1. Suddenly a wild **reviewer** appears!
1. **Reviewer** assigns the PR to themselves.
1. **Reviewer** leaves line comments with suggestions or questions.
1. When the **reviewer** is done they comment on the PR with an emoji, meme, pokémon, or words.
1. The **contributor** responds to feedback, makes changes, etc.
1. When the **contributor** is ready for the **reviewer** to re-review, they comment on the PR with an emoji, meme, pokémon, or words.
1. Goto 6 until both parties are happy with the PR.
1. The **reviewer** hits the big green merge button and deletes the branch.
